# Firing People

<p class="subtitle">what to do when it's someone else</p>

-   Sometimes people have good reasons for poor performance
-   But sometimes they don't
-   This is the hardest part of leading a project
-   But keeping someone on the team who shouldn't be there is bad for morale as well as productivity

## Legal Requirements

-   Every jurisdiction has rules about firing people, too
-   Again, talk to someone in Human Resources before doing anything else
-   Governance of every well-run open project spells out:
    -   Criteria for being a project member
    -   Who gets to decide when that privilege is revoked
-   *You can't wait until you need these to write them*
-   Review them before going any further

## Check With Someone

-   Hard to work with someone you dislike
    -   But not liking someone isn't sufficient reason to fire them
-   Talk to someone outside the project
    -   More likely to be objective
    -   Less likely to let something slip
    -   Less likely to feel pressured to take your side because you're the boss

## Create a Transition Plan

-   It's awkward to fire the only person who knows the password to the production server
    -   And risky as well
-   Suddenly asking someone to document their work is a give-away
-   Better to ask everyone to do it all the time
    -   Which helps keep roles and responsibilities up to date
-   Write out the steps you'll take immediately after breaking the news
    -   Change passwords on servers
    -   Remove from GitHub group
    -   Remove from mailing list
    -   Return loaned hardware
-   All of this needs to be done when someone leaves voluntarily
    -   And helps you realize just how much "stuff" your project has

## No Surprises

-   If someone is surprised they're being fired, *you* have made a mistake
-   If it's for poor behavior:
    -   They should know what's in the Code of Conduct
    -   And you should have given them warnings for minor violations
-   If it's for poor performance:
    -   You should have told them that they weren't meeting expectations…
    -   …given them a chance to explain…
    -   …and given them an opportunity to improve
-   You will feel pretty bad if they've been missing deadlines because of a family illness

## Delivery

-   Write out what you're going to say
    -   Keep it short
-   Practice it a few times
-   Then get straight to the point
-   Don't get drawn into discussion of "what if"
-   Stick to the practical matters you identified in the transition plan

## Tell the Team

-   Make sure the team hears the news from you
    -   Before rumors start to circulate
-   Keep statement brief and to the point
-   Do *not* discuss details
    -   The person you fired has a right to privacy
    -   And you don't want other team members worrying that you'll say something about them some day

## Keep a Record

-   It's hard for people to think clearly when you're angry or hurt
    -   And they may not act in good faith
-   Communicate by email
-   If they insist on a call:
    -   Ask to record it and give them permission to do the same
    -   Or have a third party present

## It's OK to Cry

-   This is the hardest part of management
    -   If it ever gets easy, you should let someone else take over
-   Remember: you can't save everyone
