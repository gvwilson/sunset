# Conclusion

## Talk About It

-   We created this guide because nothing like it existed
    -   It is incomplete, and we'd like your help
-   Share what you've learned by giving talks like [[](b:DelBoca2024)]
    or on social media
    -   Preferably Mastodon rather than X or Bluesky,
        because the latter are single points of institutional failure
-   Share what *hasn't* worked as well
    so that other people don't have to find those landmines the hard way
-   And sharing your experiences during difficult times protects your mental health
    [[](b:Pennebaker2016), [](b:Cullen2022)]
-   Take time to grieve
    -   The end of years of work will hurt, even if it is voluntary
    -   Your colleagues may be suffering as well
    -   And those who haven't been hit (yet) may have survivors' guilt
-   Remember: people often become altruistic, resourceful, and brave in the wake of disaster
    [[](b:Solnit2010), [](b:Yang2024)]

-   The best way for researchers to take preventive action
    is to become active in professional associations
    and push them to take meaningful action
    -   Unfortunately,
        there aren't meaningful professional associations in the software industry
        to join and push
-   The idea of doing this makes many people uncomfortable
    -   Membership in voluntary organizations has declined over several decades [[](b:Putnam2020)]
    -   Which means we're out of practice
-   Unfortunately, the bad guys aren't
    -   Who is more likely to run for a school board seat:
        a PhD in epidemiology or an anti-vax conspiracy theorist?
-   Right now we have to focus on preseving what we have
    -   But playing defense is just a way to lose more slowly
