<h1>Being Fired</h1>
<p class="subtitle">what to do when you have no notice at all</p>
<p>I hope you're never fired,
or if you are,
that the company handles it professionally.
In case they don't,
this advice is based on <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/daveyalba/datacamp-sexual-harassment-metoo-tech-startup">the author's experience being fired by DataCamp</a>
and on what friends and colleagues have gone through there and elsewhere.</p>
<div class="callout">
<p>I have read more than two dozen books on software engineering.
Most included advice on how to manage a team;
none included anything at all on employees' legal rights,
either individually or collectively.</p>
</div>
<dl>
<dt>Insist on a record of all conversations.</dt>
<dd>The biggest mistake you can make is to assume good faith on the part of
those who fired you.  In most jurisdictions you have a right to record any
phone calls you are part of, and if that feels too confrontational, insist
on communicating by email.  If they insist on communicating by phone or
video call, follow up immediately with an email summary and make sure you
send a copy to your personal account.</dd>
<dt>Pause before speaking or posting.</dt>
<dd>If possible, have someone you trust look everything over before you say it
or send it.  Don't use someone who still works for the company, even if they
are your closest friend: it puts them in a legally and morally difficult
position.</dd>
<dt>Keep your public statements brief.</dt>
<dd>People may care, but most won't care as much as you do.  A simple recitation
of facts is usually damning enough.</dd>
<dt>If you want to correct something online, add a timestamped amendment.</dt>
<dd>Don't just take it down or edit it: if you do, you will be accused of
rewriting history, and muddied waters only help whoever fired you.  Also, be
prepared for them to dig through everything you've ever said online and
re-post parts selectively to discredit you.</dd>
<dt>Speak directly to all the issues rather than omitting or ignoring things you'd rather not discuss.</dt>
<dd>Your honesty is your greatest asset, and it's hypocritical to criticize your
opponents for spin or selective reporting if you're doing it too,</dd>
<dt>Don't sign any agreement that might prevent you from speaking about moral or legal concerns.</dt>
<dd>Or if you do, make sure the agreement explicitly excludes your concerns
before signing it.  And yes, it's very privileged of me to be able to say
this: someone whose immigration status, essential health benefits, or family
income is being threatened may not have a choice.  That is why I think
people who do have a choice also have an obligation to fight.</dd>
<dt>Don't cite the law unless a lawyer tells you to.</dt>
<dd>The law probably doesn't mean what you think it means, and the company
almost certainly has lawyers on their side who will seize on any
misstatement or mistake you make.</dd>
<dt>Don't try to get them to acknowledge that they were wrong.</dt>
<dd>Their lawyers probably won't let them say anything that would acknowledge
wrongdoing or liability, and whatever happened probably wouldn't have if
they were the sort of people who could admit mistakes.</dd>
<dt>Go for long walks.</dt>
<dd>Or cook some healthy meals, or pick up the guitar you haven't touched in
years—anything that requires you to focus on something else for a while.
This isn't just for your mental health: exhausted people make poor
decisions, and you need to be at the top of your game. And remember, it's
OK to cry, and other people do care about you.</dd>
