<h1>Deliberate Shutdown</h1>
<p class="subtitle">when you have time to consult, plan, and iterate</p>
<ul>
<li>Deliberate (adjective): done consciously and intentionally</li>
<li>Deliberate (verb): engage in long and careful consideration</li>
<li>What pilots sometimes refer to as "controlled encounter with terrain"</li>
</ul>
<h2>When to Do It</h2>
<p>Not all projects should continue indefinitely, and leadership transitions provide natural opportunities to assess whether continuation, merger, or discontinuation makes the most sense. Evaluate project impact, resource requirements, and strategic fit with current priorities and available capabilities under new leadership. Assess whether the project's goals can be better achieved through merger with similar initiatives or whether the project has fulfilled its intended purpose and should be concluded gracefully. Consider the perspectives of key stakeholders, including funders, users, and team members, in making these decisions while recognizing that emotional attachment may influence judgment. Document the decision-making process and rationale to help stakeholders understand and accept the chosen direction.</p>
<h2>Legal and Financial</h2>
<p>Project transitions require careful handling of financial obligations including bank accounts, credit cards, subscription services, and recurring payments. Document all financial commitments with details about payment schedules, cancellation policies, and any contractual obligations that extend beyond your departure. Create a clear plan for transferring account ownership or ensuring continued payment for essential services during the transition period. Consider setting up temporary shared access or authorization for successors to manage urgent financial matters. Establish a timeline for reviewing and either transferring or canceling each financial commitment based on the project's future needs.</p>
<p>Creating a comprehensive inventory of all digital assets is essential for smooth project transitions. This should include domain names, social media accounts, cloud storage services, databases, email accounts, and any automated systems or bots. Each asset should be documented with login credentials, renewal dates, associated costs, and the level of access required for maintenance. Consider using a password manager or secure document to track this information, ensuring that successors can access everything they need. Don't forget about less obvious digital assets like analytics accounts, monitoring services, or third-party integrations that may be running in the background.</p>
<p>Managing software licenses and service agreements requires careful attention to transfer procedures and contractual obligations. Document all commercial software licenses, including seat counts, renewal dates, and transfer policies, as some licenses may not be transferable or may require vendor approval for ownership changes. Review service level agreements for cloud platforms, hosting services, and other technical infrastructure to understand termination procedures and data export options. Consider the timing of license transfers or cancellations to avoid service disruptions during critical transition periods. Maintain relationships with key vendors who can assist with smooth transitions and provide technical support during handover activities.</p>
<p>Grant-funded projects have specific reporting requirements and compliance obligations that must be maintained during leadership transitions to avoid funding penalties or legal issues. Review all active grants to identify upcoming reporting deadlines, required deliverables, and any personnel change notification requirements that funders may have established. Ensure that new project leaders understand the full scope of grant obligations and have access to all necessary documentation and financial records required for compliance. Consider whether leadership changes affect the project's ability to meet original grant commitments and communicate any necessary modifications to funders as early as possible. Maintain detailed records of all grant-related communications and decisions during the transition period to support future reporting and audit requirements.</p>
<h2>Permissions</h2>
<p>Once you know whether your institution has a policy,
get whatever sign-offs you need immediately.
Reach out to colleagues who can review your code if that is necessary for publishing it,
and review theirs if asked in return.
If it appears that there is no formal sign-off process,
send an email to someone in authority
(e.g., the chair of your department or your grant officer)
saying that you believe this to be the case,
and copy that email to an account you will be able to access
after leaving your institution.</p>
<p>Do not assume that if you had permission before,
you have it now or will have it in the future.
Policies are changing rapidly,
and you may find yourself locked into one that no longer allows you to do what you want.
Also consider that the person you report to may be replaced with one who knows you less well or is less sympathetic,
so acting now may be easier than acting later.</p>
<p>Finally,
if you have your next job lined up,
ask about their policies
and make sure that your right to share your work is written into your contract.
Making your code comply with policy after the fact is riskier and more time-consuming than doing so early,
and sometimes not possible.</p>
<h2>Assets</h2>
<p>Proper data archiving according to FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) ensures research value persists beyond project transitions. Identify all datasets, analysis scripts, and associated documentation that need to be preserved, ensuring they meet institutional and funding agency requirements for data management. Choose appropriate repositories based on data type, access requirements, and long-term preservation capabilities, considering both institutional repositories and discipline-specific archives. Create comprehensive metadata and documentation that enables future researchers to understand and utilize the data effectively. Establish clear data access policies and procedures for how others can request and use the archived materials.</p>
<p>Research projects often involve sensitive data subject to privacy regulations, institutional policies, or confidentiality agreements that require special handling during transitions. Review all data handling agreements, ethics approvals, and confidentiality commitments to understand restrictions on data access, transfer, or sharing that may affect transition planning. Ensure that successors receive appropriate training and authorization to handle sensitive data according to established protocols and legal requirements. Document all data security measures, access controls, and audit trails that must be maintained throughout the transition process. Consider whether any data should be anonymized, archived, or destroyed as part of the transition to reduce ongoing compliance burdens for successors.</p>
<p>When technical expertise is concentrated in one or two individuals, special strategies are needed to ensure knowledge transfer and project continuity. Identify the most critical technical knowledge and skills that are not documented and prioritize these for intensive knowledge transfer activities such as pair programming, shadowing, or intensive documentation sessions. Create multiple formats for knowledge sharing including written documentation, video recordings, and hands-on training sessions to accommodate different learning styles and reference needs. Establish ongoing mentorship or consulting arrangements with departing technical experts to provide support during the initial transition period when questions and issues are most likely to arise. Consider whether external consultants or contractors might be needed to fill technical gaps while new team members develop expertise.</p>
<h2>Community</h2>
<p>Maintaining positive vendor relationships during leadership changes requires proactive communication and clear transition protocols. Notify key vendors about upcoming leadership changes well in advance, introducing them to successors and ensuring continuity of service relationships. Review all contracts for clauses related to personnel changes, as some agreements may require notification or approval for changes in project leadership. Document the history and context of vendor relationships, including any ongoing issues, negotiated terms, or special arrangements that may not be reflected in formal contracts. Establish clear contact protocols so vendors know whom to reach during the transition period and beyond.</p>
<p>Uncertainty during leadership transitions can significantly impact team productivity and morale, requiring proactive management strategies. Establish clear communication channels and regular check-ins to address concerns and provide updates on transition progress. Be transparent about what is known and unknown about the project's future while emphasizing opportunities for growth and new directions. Recognize that different team members may react differently to change, with some embracing new possibilities while others feel anxious about stability. Create opportunities for team input on transition decisions and maintain focus on immediate project goals to provide stability during uncertain times.</p>
<p>Systematic exit interviews with departing team members capture valuable institutional knowledge that might otherwise be lost. Develop a structured interview process that covers both explicit knowledge (documented processes, technical details) and tacit knowledge (informal relationships, unwritten practices, historical context). Focus on identifying critical knowledge gaps and potential risks that may not be immediately obvious to remaining team members. Document these conversations and create action plans for preserving or transferring the most important insights. Consider conducting follow-up interviews several weeks after departure when additional knowledge gaps may become apparent.</p>
<h2>Project</h2>
<p>\item
  Submit your code for peer review and publication in a venue such as
  the \href{https://joss.theoj.org/}{Journal of Open Source Software},
  the \href{https://openresearchsoftware.metajnl.com/}{Journal of Open Research Software},
  the \href{http://www.jstatsoft.org}{Journal of Statistical Software},
  the \href{https://journal.r-project.org/}{R Journal},
  \href{https://ropensci.org/}{rOpenSci},
  or \href{https://www.pyopensci.org}{pyOpenSci}.</p>
<p>\item
  Document how to \emph{use} your software so that others can pick it up and use it if you are not available.
  In particular,
  add a \texttt{README.md} at the root of your repository
  that explains the purpose, setup, and use of your work,
  and add a tutorial showing how to use the major components of the code
  \cite{Lee2018b,Huybrechts2024,Littauer2025,Katz2025,Turing2025}.</p>
<p>\item
  Document any datasets your project depends on,
  and use CSV, JSON, Parquet, HDF5, or other widely-recognized formats rather than proprietary formats.
  Include the data in your project if possible;
  if that is not possible for legal reasons or because of the data's size,
  include URLs with data version IDs (or the date of the last download) in your documentation.</p>
<p>\item
  Describe your project's dependencies in a machine-readable way
  using Python's \href{https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/writing-pyproject-toml/}{pyproject.toml} file,
  an npm \href{https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v10/configuring-npm/package-json?v=true}{package.json} file,
  the \texttt{DESCRIPTION} and \texttt{NAMESPACE} files of an R package,
  a \href{https://openssf.org/technical-initiatives/sbom-tools/}{software bill of materials} (SBOM),
  or whatever else is standard for your language.</p>
<p>\item
  Write at least a few tests for your software
  so that people who want to use it (or contribute to it)
  can tell if it is working in their environment.
  These do not have to be formal unit tests \cite{Irving2021}:
  even a handful of ``this input should produce this output'' checks
  can save a lot of frustration \cite{Taschuk2017},
  Including sample inputs is also helpful,
  and removes dependence on external data sources which may themselves face continuity challenges.</p>
<p>\item
  Document how to \emph{contribute} to your software,
  e.g.,
  how to set up a development environment,
  run tests,
  and add new features.
  Such a guide leads to an increase in contributions \cite{Sholler2019},
  as does an explanation of the project's governance,
  i.e.,
  how decisions are made and who gets a voice in making them.</p>
