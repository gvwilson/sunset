<h1>Firing People</h1>
<p class="subtitle">what to do when it's someone else</p>
<ul>
<li>Sometimes people have good reasons for poor performance</li>
<li>But sometimes they don't</li>
<li>This is the hardest part of leading a project</li>
<li>But keeping someone on the team who shouldn't be there is bad for morale as well as productivity</li>
</ul>
<h2>Legal Requirements</h2>
<ul>
<li>Every jurisdiction has rules about firing people, too</li>
<li>Again, talk to someone in Human Resources before doing anything else</li>
<li>Governance of every well-run open project spells out:<ul>
<li>Criteria for being a project member</li>
<li>Who gets to decide when that privilege is revoked</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>You can't wait until you need these to write them</em></li>
<li>Review them before going any further</li>
</ul>
<h2>Check With Someone</h2>
<ul>
<li>Hard to work with someone you dislike<ul>
<li>But not liking someone isn't sufficient reason to fire them</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Talk to someone outside the project<ul>
<li>More likely to be objective</li>
<li>Less likely to let something slip</li>
<li>Less likely to feel pressured to take your side because you're the boss</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Create a Transition Plan</h2>
<ul>
<li>It's awkward to fire the only person who knows the password to the production server<ul>
<li>And risky as well</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Suddenly asking someone to document their work is a give-away</li>
<li>Better to ask everyone to do it all the time<ul>
<li>Which helps keep roles and responsibilities up to date</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Write out the steps you'll take immediately after breaking the news<ul>
<li>Change passwords on servers</li>
<li>Remove from GitHub group</li>
<li>Remove from mailing list</li>
<li>Return loaned hardware</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>All of this needs to be done when someone leaves voluntarily<ul>
<li>And helps you realize just how much "stuff" your project has</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>No Surprises</h2>
<ul>
<li>If someone is surprised they're being fired, <em>you</em> have made a mistake</li>
<li>If it's for poor behavior:<ul>
<li>They should know what's in the Code of Conduct</li>
<li>And you should have given them warnings for minor violations</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If it's for poor performance:<ul>
<li>You should have told them that they weren't meeting expectations…</li>
<li>…given them a chance to explain…</li>
<li>…and given them an opportunity to improve</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You will feel pretty bad if they've been missing deadlines because of a family illness</li>
</ul>
<h2>Delivery</h2>
<ul>
<li>Write out what you're going to say<ul>
<li>Keep it short</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Practice it a few times</li>
<li>Then get straight to the point</li>
<li>Don't get drawn into discussion of "what if"</li>
<li>Stick to the practical matters you identified in the transition plan</li>
</ul>
<h2>Tell the Team</h2>
<ul>
<li>Make sure the team hears the news from you<ul>
<li>Before rumors start to circulate</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Keep statement brief and to the point</li>
<li>Do <em>not</em> discuss details<ul>
<li>The person you fired has a right to privacy</li>
<li>And you don't want other team members worrying that you'll say something about them some day</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Keep a Record</h2>
<ul>
<li>It's hard for people to think clearly when you're angry or hurt<ul>
<li>And they may not act in good faith</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Communicate by email</li>
<li>If they insist on a call:<ul>
<li>Ask to record it and give them permission to do the same</li>
<li>Or have a third party present</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>It's OK to Cry</h2>
<ul>
<li>This is the hardest part of management<ul>
<li>If it ever gets easy, you should let someone else take over</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Remember: you can't save everyone</li>
</ul>
