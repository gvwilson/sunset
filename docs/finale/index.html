<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p class="subtitle">looking back and next steps</p>
<h2>Talk About It</h2>
<ul>
<li>We created this guide because nothing like it existed<ul>
<li>It is incomplete, and we'd like your help</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Share what you've learned by giving talks like [<a href="../bibliography/#DelBoca2024">DelBoca2024</a>]
    or on social media<ul>
<li>Preferably Mastodon rather than X or Bluesky,
    because the latter are single points of institutional failure</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Share what <em>hasn't</em> worked as well
    so that other people don't have to find those landmines the hard way</li>
<li>And sharing your experiences during difficult times protects your mental health
    [<a href="../bibliography/#Pennebaker2016">Pennebaker2016</a>, <a href="../bibliography/#Cullen2022">Cullen2022</a>]</li>
<li>Take time to grieve<ul>
<li>The end of years of work will hurt, even if it is voluntary</li>
<li>Your colleagues may be suffering as well</li>
<li>And those who haven't been hit (yet) may have survivors' guilt</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Remember: people often become altruistic, resourceful, and brave in the wake of disaster
    [<a href="../bibliography/#Solnit2010">Solnit2010</a>, <a href="../bibliography/#Yang2024">Yang2024</a>]</li>
</ul>
<h2>Organize</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>There's no point surviving today's flood if you drown in tomorrow's.</p>
<p>— variously attributed</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The best way for researchers to take preventive action
    is to become active in professional associations
    and push them to take meaningful action<ul>
<li>Unfortunately,
    there aren't meaningful professional associations in the software industry
    to join and push</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The idea of doing this makes many people uncomfortable<ul>
<li>Membership in voluntary organizations has declined over several decades [<a href="../bibliography/#Putnam2020">Putnam2020</a>]</li>
<li>Which means we're out of practice</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Unfortunately, the bad guys aren't<ul>
<li>Who is more likely to run for a school board seat:
    a PhD in epidemiology or an anti-vax conspiracy theorist?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Right now we have to focus on preseving what we have<ul>
<li>But playing defense is just a way to lose more slowly</li>
</ul>
