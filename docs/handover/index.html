<h1>Voluntary Handover</h1>
<p class="subtitle">the best-case scenario</p>
<ul>
<li>You have decided to leave a project that you founded or currently lead</li>
<li>The project is continuing after your departure</li>
<li>You have time to prepare a graceful transition</li>
</ul>
<h2>Before</h2>
<ul>
<li>Be sure you mean it.<ul>
<li>Letting go will be hard on you
    but <em>not</em> letting go will be even harder on your successors</li>
<li>So be sure you actually mean it</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Do it when others think it's time<ul>
<li>You will often be the last person to realize that you ought to be moving on</li>
<li>So ask people and pay attention to what they say</li>
<li>Which means you need to know people who will tell you the truth</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Explain what, when, and why<ul>
<li>Tell people you're leaving as soon as you're sure</li>
<li>Prevents rumors, gossip, and speculation</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Don't pick a successor by yourself<ul>
<li>You will probably have strong opinions about who should succeed you</li>
<li>But <em>you are not objective</em></li>
<li>And what the project needs now is probably different from what it used to need</li>
<li>Involving others in the planning also builds community</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<section class="exercise">
<h3>Exercise</h3>
<ol>
<li>Who should be involved in picking your successor?</li>
<li>Write a draft of the message you will send to your community
    and/or post on your project website
    announcing your departure,
    and review it with others in a small group.</li>
</ol>
</section>
<h2>During</h2>
<ul>
<li>Write a succession plan<ul>
<li>Final state: what is your successor actually responsible for?</li>
<li>Transition: what are you handing over to them when?</li>
<li>First draft on your own, final draft with your successor</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Hand over gradually if you can<ul>
<li>Start sharing tasks with your successor a few weeks before you leave</li>
<li>They will get to see how things actually work</li>
<li>You'll discover things you would otherwise forget to tell them</li>
<li>Go on holiday for a week and leave your successor temporarily in charge</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Have some fun before you go<ul>
<li>People remember beginnings and endings more than middles</li>
<li>So don't just slog your way to the end and turn out the lights</li>
<li>Instead, pick a small project you never quite got around to and do one final sprint</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<section class="exercise">
<h3>Exercise</h3>
<ol>
<li>What have you done in the last week that your successor will be responsible for?
    Which of these are easiest for your successor to start with?</li>
<li>What have you done in the last year that only needs to be done occasionally?
    Which of these can be practiced now,
    and which can only be done when the time comes?</li>
<li>What is the most satisfying small thing you could do before you step away?</li>
</ol>
</section>
<h2>After</h2>
<ul>
<li>When you leave, leave<ul>
<li>Tempting to continue to have a role in the organization</li>
<li>But that is confusing because people are used to looking to you for answers</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Leave <em>for</em> something<ul>
<li>People who start things usually aren't good with idleness,
    and idleness tends not to be good for them</li>
<li>So have your next project lined up, even if it's small</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Reflect on what you learned<ul>
<li>Write down what you learned and what you could have done differently</li>
<li>Helps you move on</li>
<li>Helps with the next thing you do</li>
<li>Helps your successor and other people</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Celebrate the good things<ul>
<li>Many people only reflect on could-have-beens</li>
<li>Write down what you accomplished as well</li>
<li>It's just as important for your successors and the community
    as it is for you</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="callout">
<p>The word "mistake" means "an action or judgment that was wrong".
English doesn't have a single word that means "an action or judgment that was right",
which says something about human nature in general
or English speakers in particular.</p>
</div>
<section class="exercise">
<h3>Exercise</h3>
<ol>
<li>Write down (at least) three things you think you accomplished while leading your project.</li>
<li>Write down (at most) three things that you think you could have done better.</li>
<li>What are three things you would like to do after you leave your project?</li>
</ol>
