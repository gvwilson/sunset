<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p class="subtitle">what this training does and doesn't cover</p>
<ul>
<li>For every beginning there must be an ending</li>
<li>But we don't like to talk about that<ul>
<li>Thousands of books in print about how to start a business</li>
<li>Only a handful about how to pass one on or wind one down</li>
<li>And many of those are really about how to sell out at the right time</li>
<li>Because mortality scares us</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Preparing for the end can make the end less likely<ul>
<li>It also helps make what happens before then more enjoyable</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best vs. Good Enough</h2>
<ul>
<li>[<a href="../bibliography/#Wilson2014">Wilson2014</a>] outlined how <a href="../glossary/#rse">research software engineers</a> should organize their projetcs</li>
<li>[<a href="../bibliography/#Wilson2017">Wilson2017</a>] was in part a rebuttal<ul>
<li>Most people don't have time to do everything the "right" way</li>
<li>By which we actually mean "their employers don't give them enough time"</li>
<li>So comparing what they do to "best practices" is as unfair as
    comparing what a surgeon does at leisure in a well-equipped hospital
to what a paramedic does at a crash site</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This workshop addresses both kinds of setting<ul>
<li><a href="@root/#learner-vaida">Vaida</a> has enough time to plan
    and to correct things that she initially gets wrong</li>
<li><a href="@root/#learner-liam">Liam</a> only has time to do a few things,
    and will not be able to go back and fix anything he didn't get right</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Threat Models</h2>
<ul>
<li>What situation you are in usually depends on external factors<ul>
<li>Use the technique of <a href="../glossary/#threat-modeling">threat modeling</a> from computer security
    to think about them</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="../glossary/#individual-threat">Individual threats</a> affect one or a few members of your team<ul>
<li>Can come from mundane career or life changes (illness, new job opportunity)</li>
<li>Or external factors (international students' visas revoked with little warning)</li>
<li><a href="../glossary/#leadership-threat">Leadership threats</a> are specifically aimed the project's leader
    (e.g., being targeted in the media for politically unpopular research findings)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="../glossary/#community-threat">Community threats</a> affect large groups<ul>
<li>E.g., department being shut down</li>
<li>Affect so many people at the same time that the community cannot buffer the shock<ul>
<li>And might not survive it</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climatic_Research_Unit_email_controversy">Climategate</a> affected dozens of people directly
    and damaged the entire climate research community</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="../glossary/#global-threat">Global threats</a> affect everyone<ul>
<li>Which means other communities cannot help</li>
<li>And there may not be anywhere to run to</li>
<li>E.g., current attacks on science in the United States</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="callout">
<p>Governments make emergency plans to deal with community threats
(if they are responsible enough to admit their existence).
When governments themselves are in upheaval,
people turn to <a href="../glossary/#civil-society">civil society</a> for help [<a href="../bibliography/#Solnit2010">Solnit2010</a>].</p>
</div>
<section class="exercise">
<h3>Exercise</h3>
<ol>
<li>Are you handing over or shutting down?<ul>
<li>Can think of shutdown as "succession to zero"</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Do you have days or months to prepare?<ul>
<li>The former is usually involuntary</li>
<li>The latter allows for (some) structural changes before and during handover</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Can you act unilaterally or do other people have a veto?<ul>
<li><em>Not</em> "have a stake in the outcome", but rather can disagree with you and make it stick</li>
<li>Subsidiary question: are those "other people" your peers or your superiors (e.g., your employer)?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Can you talk to someone who has been through this before?</li>
</ol>
</section>
<h2>No Abstinence Solutions</h2>
<ul>
<li>An <a href="../glossary/#abstinence-solution">abstinence solution</a> is one that requires people
    to behave in ways we know they won't<ul>
<li>See also "<a href="../glossary/#bullshit">bullshit</a>" [<a href="../bibliography/#Frankfurt2005">Frankfurt2005</a>]</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>"Document everything" doesn't work<ul>
<li>People will always short-change writing descriptions of work in favor of actually doing work</li>
<li>And fail to write down the parts of their work that they think are obvious</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Stay Within the Law</h2>
<ul>
<li>Ensuring your work remains usable is not worth putting yourself at legal risk<ul>
<li>Institutions, journals, and funders have policies for licensing and sharing [<a href="../bibliography/#Katz2018">Katz2018</a>].</li>
<li>So find out what those rules are and make sure you stay within them</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If you don't know if there is a policy or not, <em>ask someone</em><ul>
<li>Look for an <a href="https://sustainoss.org/academic-map/universities/index.html">Open Source Program Office</a> (OSPO) or intellectual property (IP) office</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Here and elsewhere, use email rather than chat or video calls to create a record</li>
</ul>
<div class="callout">
<p>There is often a difference in large bureaucratic organization
between the rules as written and the rules as enforced.
If you are leaving your position on short notice or under difficult circumstances,
you may want to be selective about which forms you fill in proactively
and which you "just haven't gotten around to yet".
Members of marginalized groups have had more practice with these tactics
than members of privileged groups [<a href="../bibliography/#Scott1987">Scott1987</a>];
if you belong to the latter,
a quiet conversation or two with selected colleagues may help you see your priorities more clearly.</p>
</div>
<h2>Not Covered</h2>
<ul>
<li>Community building<ul>
<li>Lots of good guides,
    including [<a href="../bibliography/#Alinsky1989">Alinsky1989</a>, <a href="../bibliography/#Brown2007">Brown2007</a>, <a href="../bibliography/#Lakey2018">Lakey2018</a>]</li>
<li>We assume you have to use the community you already have</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Communication skills<ul>
<li>We'll talk about <em>what</em> to say but not (much) about <em>how</em> to say it</li>
<li>See [<a href="../bibliography/#Kuchner2011">Kuchner2011</a>] for some useful insights</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For-profit businesses<ul>
<li>We assume your project project isn't supposed to turn a profit</li>
<li>And that growth for its own sake hasn't been your goal [<a href="../bibliography/#Burlingham2016">Burlingham2016</a>]</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
