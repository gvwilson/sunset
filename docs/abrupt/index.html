<h1>Abrupt Shutdown</h1>
<p class="subtitle">when the best you can do is to save what you can</p>
<h2>Priorities</h2>
<p>\item
  Explanations of what the software \emph{does} and \emph{how to use it}
  take priority over documentation of its internals
  because (a) someone who knows the first two will be better able to figure out the third
  and (b) AI code assistants can do a reasonable job of helping newcomers navigate an unfamiliar code base
  if they are given enough context.</p>
<p>\item
  Similarly,
  a short screencast showing how you use your software
  is often faster to create than pages of documentation,
  and may actually be more useful if closed captions are attached
  to make the content searchable.
  Again,
  AI tools can help create those captions,
  though some editing is invariably required to clean up mistranslation of technical jargon.</p>
<p>\item
  You can \href{https://archive.softwareheritage.org/browse/search/}{search the Software Heritage Archive} with your repository URL to check whether it has been saved.
  If your repository is not present, there is a \href{https://archive.softwareheritage.org/save/}{simple process} to submit it for archival.</p>
<p>\item
  If you do not have time to bring your project in line with best practices,
  try instead to clean it up by removing files that are no longer used,
  deleting sections of your setup instructions that no longer apply,
  closing bug reports that are no longer relevant,
  and so on.
  Eliminating clutter in this way will make what is useful easier to find.</p>
<p>\item
  Briefly document what happened.
  If you are the main developer working on a grant and you have moved on to something else,
  say that in the README.
  If the funding changed, then say that the work is unfunded.
  This information is often the most useful for users but the hardest to find.
  Saying it up front will help others understand how your work is positioned.</p>
<p>\item
  You can search the \href{https://archive.softwareheritage.org/browse/search/}{Software Heritage Archive}
  to check if your repository has been saved.
  If not,
  submitting it is a \href{https://archive.softwareheritage.org/save/}{simple process}.</p>
